# RAVDESS-Audio-Emotion-Advanced-Data-Mining-Project


This repository contains the final project for the **Data Mining 2** course, focused on advanced data analysis of the **RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)** dataset.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform a complete advanced data mining workflow for emotion recognition from audio features. The analysis includes:

- **Data understanding and preprocessing**
- **Feature selection** and **dimensionality reduction**
- **Outlier detection** and **handling data imbalance**
- **Advanced classification and regression models** (SVM, Neural Networks, Ensemble methods)
- **Time series analysis**
- **Model explainability** using **LIME** and **SHAP**

## Repository Structure
-  `Datasets/` → Contains the training and test datasets (`RavdessAudioOnlyFeatures_TRAIN.csv`, `RavdessAudioOnlyFeatures_TEST.csv`).
-  `Notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for each phase of the analysis.
-  `DM2_Progetto dicandia.pdf` → Final project report describing the methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Tools and Libraries
The analysis was implemented in **Python** using:
`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `imbalanced-learn`, `LIME`, and `SHAP`.
